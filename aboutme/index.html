    <h2>Elizabeth</h2>
    <p>My name is Elizabeth. I am from Massachusetts. I have lived there most of my life. I lived in Utah for some time when I served a mission. I also have lived in Idaho while attending Brigham Young University-Idaho. I am an accounting major. I highly recommend!</p>
    <p>I have a few different hobbies. I love to sew. I like to sew things that I use like clothes. I have made a quilted picnic blanket, a pillow, and a tote bag. I like to create things, which is also why I like Legos so much. I enjoy reading. I like fantasy, mystery, and adventure books. Sandwiches are my favorite food.

    <p>I am taking this course because I think it will be useful. I don't know how to make a website, so I think it would be useful to know incase I ever need to. I have taken an introduction class to coding, and really enjoyed it. This will add to my knowledge of coding and provide me with different skills.</p>
